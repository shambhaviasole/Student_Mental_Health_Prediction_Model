# Student_Mental_Health_Prediction_Model

This project aims to assess and predict the mental health status of students using machine learning. Based on inputs like screen time, sleep habits, stress levels, physical activity, and academic performance, the model classifies students as Mentally Fit or Unfit. It features a simple frontend for data collection and a backend built with Django to process input and return predictions using a trained Decision Tree Classifier.
